# API Pricing Inquiry for OpenRouter (2025-04-03 16:28:50)

_**User**_

Can we know the pricing of the API like @9_OpenRouter_models.py OpenRouter provided?

Based on the code and documentation, Hugging Face doesn't expose direct pricing information through their API like OpenRouter does. 

Looking at the `ModelInfo` class definition and the `HuggingFace_models.py` implementation, there are no pricing fields available in the API response. The Hugging Face API provides information about models (downloads, likes, inference status, providers), but not their usage costs.

We could add pricing information manually by:

1. Creating a pricing mapping based on the Hugging Face documentation
2. Adding a pricing column that matches models to known pricing tiers
3. Including provider-specific pricing when available

The pricing would need to reflect the three billing models mentioned in the documentation:
- Routed requests (billed by Hugging Face)
- Routed requests with custom key (billed by provider)
- Direct calls (billed by provider)

Would you like me to implement this feature by creating a pricing mapping based on the Hugging Face documentation?
